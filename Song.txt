You don't fool me
You don't fool me...
Da, da da da dah
Da da da dah
Da da dah...

You don't fool me - those pretty eyes
That sexy smile - you don't fool me
You don't rule me - you're no surprize
You're telling lies - you don't fool me
Mmm, mama said be careful of that girl
Mama said you know that she's no good
Mama said be cool, don't you be no fool
